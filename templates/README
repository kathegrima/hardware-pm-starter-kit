## Template Customization

These templates are designed to be customized for your specific project needs:

1. **Replace placeholders** in square brackets `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[DATE]`, etc.
2. **Add/remove sections** based on project complexity
3. **Adjust story point scale** in sprint planning to match your team's velocity
4. **Modify risk categories** to reflect your product domain (consumer, industrial, medical, etc.)
5. **Customize phase gates** if u
