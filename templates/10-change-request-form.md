## Introduction

### What is ECR/ECO?

**ECR (Engineering Change Request)**:
- Proposal for a design change
- Submitted by anyone (engineering, QA, manufacturing, customer support)
- Includes problem description, proposed solution, justification
- Status: Pending review and approval

**ECO (Engineering Change Order)**:
- Approved change request
- Authorized for implementation
- Includes implementation plan, verification plan, approvals
- Status: Approved → In Progress → Complete

---

### Why Change Control Matters

**Without formal change control**:
- ❌ Undocumented changes → can't reproduce older builds
- ❌ Unintended consequences → change breaks other features
- ❌ Configuration confusion → which units have which changes?
- ❌ Compliance issues → can't prove what was shipped
- ❌ Cost overruns → unplanned tooling changes, inventory obsolescence

**With formal change control**:
- ✅ Traceability → every change documented, approved, tracked
- ✅ Impact assessment → understand ripple effects before implementing
- ✅ Configuration management → know exactly what's in each build
- ✅ Compliance → audit trail for regulatory requirements
- ✅ Cost control → evaluate cost/benefit before approving changes

---

### Change Control Milestones

**Design Freeze (DVT Exit)**:
- **Before design freeze**: Informal change process OK (email, Jira ticket)
- **After design freeze**: Formal ECR/ECO process REQUIRED

**Reason**: After DVT, design is validated (tested, compliant, manufacturable). Changes risk regression, retest, recertification.

## Change Control Process Overview

### Process Flow

```
1. IDENTIFY NEED
   ├─ Issue found (bug, field failure, cost reduction opportunity)
   └─ Solution proposed

2. SUBMIT ECR
   ├─ Fill out ECR form
   ├─ Describe problem, proposed solution, justification
   └─ Submit to Change Control Board (CCB)

3. REVIEW ECR (CCB Meeting)
   ├─ Assess impact (technical, cost, schedule, compliance)
   ├─ Evaluate alternatives
   ├─ Decision: Approve / Reject / Defer / Request More Info
   └─ If approved → Convert ECR to ECO

4. IMPLEMENT ECO
   ├─ Update design (schematic, PCB, firmware, mechanical, BOM)
   ├─ Update documentation (manuals, test procedures, labels)
   ├─ Procure new components (if BOM change)
   └─ Build prototype with change

5. VERIFY ECO
   ├─ Test prototype (regression testing + change-specific testing)
   ├─ Verify issue resolved
   └─ Verify no new issues introduced

6. CLOSE ECO
   ├─ CCB reviews verification results
   ├─ Approve release to production
   └─ Update all affected documents and systems
```

---

### Change Control Board (CCB)

**Purpose**: Evaluate and approve/reject change requests

**Members**:
- **Project Manager** (chair) - Schedule, budget, overall impact
- **Hardware Lead** - Technical feasibility, hardware impact
- **Firmware Lead** - Firmware impact
- **Mechanical Lead** - Mechanical impact
- **Manufacturing** - Manufacturability, tooling, yield impact
- **QA/Test** - Testing impact, regression risk
- **Compliance** - Regulatory impact (retest, recertification)
- **Supply Chain** - BOM impact, lead time, cost

**Meeting Cadence**:
- **Before Design Freeze**: As needed (informal)
- **After Design Freeze**: Weekly or bi-weekly (formal)

---

## When to Use ECR/ECO

### REQUIRED (Must Use ECR/ECO)

**After Design Freeze (DVT Exit)**:
- ✅ Any change to frozen design (schematic, PCB, BOM, firmware, mechanical, labels)
- ✅ Changes affecting compliance (EMC, safety, RoHS)
- ✅ Changes affecting form/fit/function (customer-visible)
- ✅ Changes affecting manufacturing (assembly process, test procedure, tooling)

**Example Scenarios**:
- Change resistor value from 10kΩ to 4.7kΩ (affects circuit function)
- Replace component due to EOL (different MPN)
- Add test point to PCB (PCB layout change)
- Update enclosure to fix assembly issue (tooling change)
- Update firmware to fix critical bug (regression risk)

---

### OPTIONAL (Use Judgment)

**Before Design Freeze (EVT/DVT)**:
- Iterative design changes (expected during development)
- Minor tweaks (passive value changes during tuning)
- Firmware updates (separate version control typically sufficient)

**Best Practice**: Even before freeze, use ECR/ECO for major changes (e.g., swap MCU, change sensor, major mechanical redesign)

---

### NOT REQUIRED

- Firmware-only changes (use separate firmware change control)
- Documentation updates (typo fixes, formatting)
- Internal process changes (doesn't affect product)

---

## Change Classification

### Critical Change

**Definition**: Change affecting safety, compliance, or core functionality

**Examples**:
- Safety-related changes (electrical, thermal, mechanical)
- Compliance-related changes (affects EMC, LVD, RED, RoHS)
- Core functionality broken (product unusable)
- Major performance degradation (>20% from spec)

**Approval Required**:
- Full CCB approval (all members must sign)
- Executive approval (if affects launch date or budget >10%)

**Testing Required**:
- Full regression testing
- Compliance retesting (if affected)
- Field trial (if feasible)

**Effective Date**:
- Immediate (if safety/compliance)
- Next build (if functionality)

---

### Major Change

**Definition**: Significant design change with moderate impact

**Examples**:
- Component substitution (not pin-compatible)
- PCB layout change (routing, layer stack)
- Mechanical design change (enclosure, mounting)
- Firmware architecture change
- Performance optimization (>10% improvement)

**Approval Required**:
- CCB approval (majority vote)
- PM approval (if schedule impact >1 week or cost >€5K)

**Testing Required**:
- Targeted testing (change-specific)
- Partial regression testing (affected subsystems)

**Effective Date**:
- Next build (typically)

---

### Minor Change

**Definition**: Small change with limited impact

**Examples**:
- Passive component value tweak (resistor, capacitor)
- Pin-compatible component substitution (second source)
- Cosmetic change (label, color)
- Documentation update (typo fix, clarification)
- Test procedure improvement

**Approval Required**:
- Change Owner + PM approval (expedited)
- CCB notification (no meeting required)

**Testing Required**:
- Basic functional test (smoke test)
- Change-specific verification only

**Effective Date**:
- Next build or ASAP

---

## Approval Workflow

### Pre-Design Freeze (EVT/DVT)

**Process**: Lightweight, email-based

1. Engineer identifies need for change
2. Engineer emails PM + Leads with description
3. PM approves (or escalates to CCB if major)
4. Engineer implements change
5. Engineer documents change in design files (commit message, revision notes)

**No formal ECR/ECO required** (unless major change)

---

### Post-Design Freeze (PVT/MP)

**Process**: Formal ECR/ECO required

1. **Submit ECR**
   - Submitter fills out ECR form
   - Submitter emails to PM (CCB chair)
   - PM adds to CCB agenda

2. **CCB Meeting** (weekly or bi-weekly)
   - Review ECR (problem, solution, impact)
   - Discuss alternatives
   - Vote: Approve / Reject / Defer / Request More Info
   - If approved → PM assigns ECO number and Change Owner

3. **Implement ECO**
   - Change Owner implements per ECO plan
   - Change Owner updates status in progress log
   - Change Owner escalates blockers to PM

4. **Verify ECO**
   - QA/Test executes verification plan
   - QA/Test documents results in ECO form

5. **Close ECO** (CCB Meeting)
   - CCB reviews verification results
   - CCB approves release to production
   - PM closes ECO, updates change log

---

### Expedited Approval (Critical Changes)

**Trigger**: Critical issue blocking production or safety/compliance risk

**Process**:
1. Submitter marks ECR as "Critical"
2. PM convenes emergency CCB meeting (within 24 hours)
3. CCB evaluates and approves/rejects immediately
4. If approved → expedited implementation (parallel design + build)
5. Verification completes ASAP (may ship with open ECO if low risk)

**Condition**: Post-implementation verification mandatory (close ECO within 2 weeks)

---

## Implementation & Verification

### Implementation Best Practices

**Design Changes**:
- [ ] Update all design files (schematic, PCB, firmware, mechanical)
- [ ] Increment revision numbers (per revision control policy)
- [ ] Add revision notes (what changed, why, ECO reference)
- [ ] Archive old revision (before overwriting)

**Documentation Changes**:
- [ ] Update all affected documents (manuals, test procedures, labels)
- [ ] Mark changes (revision bars, redline, or track changes)
- [ ] Increment document revision numbers
- [ ] Archive old revisions

**BOM Changes**:
- [ ] Update BOM spreadsheet/PLM system
- [ ] Add/remove/change components as needed
- [ ] Update AVL (Approved Vendor List) if new suppliers
- [ ] Request RoHS/REACH declarations for new components

**System Updates**:
- [ ] Update ERP/PLM system (SKU, BOM, routing)
- [ ] Update inventory system (new component stocking)
- [ ] Update manufacturing work instructions
- [ ] Update test procedures

---

### Verification Best Practices

**Change-Specific Testing**:
- Test the specific change (verify issue resolved)
- Test boundary conditions (edge cases)
- Test failure modes (what happens if change fails?)

**Regression Testing**:
- Test all critical functionality (ensure no new issues)
- Test interfaces (HW-FW, HW-mechanical, product-accessory)
- Test environmental limits (temperature, humidity if affected)

**Compliance Retesting** (if applicable):
- Identify which tests are affected by change
- Consult with test lab (may not need full retest)
- Example: Resistor value change → EMC retest, but not LVD/RED

**Verification Documentation**:
- Document all test results in ECO form
- Attach evidence (test reports, photos, data logs)
- Sign off on verification completion

**Don't wait until production** to establish change control. Practice during DVT so the process is smooth by PVT.

---

### 2. Assess Impact Thoroughly

**Don't rush approval**. Take time to understand ripple effects. A small change (e.g., resistor value) can have big impacts (e.g., EMC retest).

---

### 3. Document Everything

**Future you will thank you**. When debugging a field failure 6 months later, you'll need to know exactly what changed and when.

---

### 4. Version Control Integration

**Tag design files** with ECO numbers in commit messages:
```
git commit -m "ECO-2026-042: Replace R5 10K with 4.7K for thermal optimization"
```

---

### 5. Consider Timing

**Batch changes** when possible. If multiple ECOs pending, implement together in one revision (reduces retest cost/time).

---

### 6. Communicate Changes

**Notify stakeholders**: Manufacturing, QA, Sales, Support, Customers (if necessary). Changes affect everyone.

---

### 7. Track Costs

**Monitor ECO costs** against budget. Excessive ECOs = poor initial design or inadequate testing.

**Typical ECO Cost Budget**: 5-10% of total development budget

## Conclusion

**Formal change control is essential for mature hardware development.**

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Design freeze = formal change control** (ECR/ECO process required)
2. **Assess impact before approving** (technical, cost, schedule, compliance)
3. **Document everything** (change log, revision history, verification results)
4. **CCB approval required** (no unauthorized changes)
5. **Verify thoroughly** (test change + regression test)

**Change control protects**:
- ✅ Product quality (no undocumented changes)
- ✅ Compliance (audit trail for regulators)
- ✅ Configuration management (know what's in each build)
- ✅ Budget and schedule (no surprise costs or delays)

**This template provides**:
