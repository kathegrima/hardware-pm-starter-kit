# Hardware Risk Register

> **Purpose**: Systematic identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks specific to hardware product development

## How to Use This Template

1. **Identify risks** across all categories during project kickoff and continuously throughout development
2. **Assess** each risk using the Impact/Likelihood matrix below
3. **Calculate Risk Score** = Impact × Likelihood (scale 1-25)
4. **Prioritize** mitigation efforts: Critical (15-25) → High (10-14) → Medium (5-9) → Low (1-4)
5. **Review** regularly at sprint planning, phase gates, and team retrospectives
6. **Update status** as risks evolve or are mitigated

## Risk Assessment Scale

### Impact (1-5)
| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Critical | Project failure, product recall, >50% budget overrun, >3 month delay, safety hazard |
| 4 | High | Major feature cut, 30-50% budget overrun, 1-3 month delay, compliance failure |
| 3 | Medium | Performance degradation, 15-30% budget overrun, 2-4 week delay, requires workaround |
| 2 | Low | Minor inconvenience, <15% budget impact, <2 week delay, cosmetic issues |
| 1 | Minimal | Negligible impact, absorbed within contingency, no delay |

### Likelihood (1-5)
| Score | Level | Probability |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Almost Certain | >70% - Expected to occur |
| 4 | Likely | 50-70% - Probably will occur |
| 3 | Possible | 30-50% - Might occur |
| 2 | Unlikely | 10-30% - Probably won't occur |
| 1 | Rare | <10% - Highly unlikely |

## Best Practices for Hardware Risk Management

### 1. Continuous Risk Identification
- Conduct risk brainstorming at project kickoff with full cross-functional team
- Add new risks as they emerge during sprints, design reviews, and testing
- Leverage FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) for systematic analysis
- Learn from past projects - review lessons learned from similar products

### 2. Prioritize Ruthlessly
- Focus mitigation efforts on Critical (15-25) and High (10-14) risks first
- Don't over-invest in Low (1-4) risks - accept or monitor them
- Re-calculate risk scores after mitigation actions (residual risk)

### 3. Mitigation Strategies
| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Avoid** | Eliminate the risk entirely | Change design to remove single-source component |
| **Reduce** | Lower probability or impact | Pre-compliance testing, dual sourcing |
| **Transfer** | Shift risk to another party | Insurance, supplier guarantees, outsourcing |
| **Accept** | Risk score acceptable | Monitor low-probability risks with contingency plan |

### 4. Phase-Specific Focus
- **Concept Phase**: Technical feasibility, market risks
- **EVT Phase**: Component availability, thermal/power, HW/SW integration
- **DVT Phase**: Compliance, manufacturing yield, cost targets
- **PVT Phase**: Supplier capacity, test coverage, production ramp

### 5. Review Cadence
- **Weekly**: Review critical (15-25) risks at sprint planning
- **Bi-weekly**: Update full risk register with team
- **Phase Gates**: Comprehensive risk review with stakeholders before gate approval
- **Post-Mortem**: Convert occurred risks into lessons learned
